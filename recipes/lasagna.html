            <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato
            sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would
            be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan.
            I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <hr>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Meat:</strong> This lasagna recipe starts
                            with a pound of ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).</li>
                        <li><strong>Onion:</strong> A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.</li>
                        <li><strong>Canned tomatoes:</strong> You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed</li>
                        <li><strong>Fresh herbs:</strong> For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and
                            crush one clove of garlic.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the tomatoes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Speces and seasonings:</strong> This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil,
                            dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.</li>
                        <li><strong>Noodles:</strong> Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls
                            for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cheese:</strong> The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan.
                            You'll also need shredded mozzarella.</li>
                        <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act
                            as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).</li>
                    </ul>

                            Add the onion and continue cooking until it's translucent. Stir in the canned tomato products,

                        <li><strong>Cook the noodles:</strong> Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly salted water until

                            the remaining parsley, the remaining salt, and pepper in a bowl.</li>
                        <li><strong>Assemble the lasagna:</strong> Layer the ingredients according to the recipe
                            (starting with sauce and ending with mozzarella) until the lasagna is assembled.</li>

                            about half an hour. Remove the foil and continue baking until the top is golden brown.
